# Solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

## Personal goals for this year:
* Use as many [generator iterators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/), [subgenerators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-380-syntax-for-delegating-to-a-subgenerator), advanced [generator-iterator methods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-iterator-methods) and [generator expressions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/) as possible
* Where applicable, use iterators from [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) and [more-itertools](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
